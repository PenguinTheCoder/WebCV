By importing UseNavigate I have given every button a onClick Event which transfers you to the other pages. //CSS - Image was wider than browser limits, so it is shrunken and centered with added Flex. Button style was borrowed from CSS Scan page. // Unfinished background. React-particles.js-npm  has been deprecated \\
